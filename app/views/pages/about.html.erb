<h3 class="heading-medium">How data.gov.uk and policy work</h3>
</p>
<p>Better data can help inform better policy-making and continuous improvement of services. Departments can combat fraud and reduce waste.</p> 

<p>By taking ethical, open, innovative and transparent approaches to data we can build greater levels of trust with citizens, whilst delivering more cost-effective and better targeted and tailored services to their needs.</p>

<p>Data is at the heart of digital transformation and the next phase of the reform of public services.</p>
